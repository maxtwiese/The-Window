## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Interest in machine learning for periocular recognition has increased with the donning of masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. With the subsequent advancements in iris segmentation I aim to apply computer vision to pupil dilation tracking. Pupil dilation can be used to measure emotional arousal and autonomic activation. [1] The goal of this project is to train a model that can measure pupil dilation from a webcam in real time. Measuring autonomic activation could be used to improved tele-mental health and in applications that teach breath work.
