## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Interest in machine learning for periocular recognition has increased with the donning of masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. With the subsequent advancements in iris segmentation I aim to apply computer vision to pupil dilation tracking. Pupil dilation can be used to measure emotional arousal and autonomic activation. [1] The goal of this project is to train a model that can measure pupil dilation from a webcam in real time. Measuring autonomic activation could be used to improved tele-mental health and in applications that teach breath work.

### 2.1 Environment and Toolkit

I am training on the PyTorch Vision framework. The following files in `src` are a part of that framework and used to execute the from thr `engine` module when called in `ddpFasterRCNN.py`:

- `coco_eval.py`
- `coco_utils.py`
- `engine.py`
- `transforms.py`
- `utils.py`
